# knuckle-pad

After getting into custom keyboards I was looking to get a gaming keypad to free up mouse space for shooters. Since none of the possible options (ranging ) were 100% what I wanted, were too expensive or simply not available anymore I decided to design my very own keyboard from scratch.
The Knuckle Pad (WIP name subject to change) is a 4x6+5 ortholinear gaming keypad, offering 3 1.25u pinky keys, 4 radially positioned thumb keys and a uniquely positioned key to press with the head of your metacarpal bone (aka. inner knuckle).


# Q&A:

Q: Why the knuckle key?

A: At some point in time I (unconsciously) developed the habit of using my knuckles to press CTRL when playing shooters as I pressing said key with my pinky fingers felt rather uncomfortable.
