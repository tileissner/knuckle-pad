# knuckle-pad

After getting into custom keyboards I was looking to get a gaming keypad to free up mouse space for shooters. Since none of the possible options were 100% what I wanted, were too expensive or simply not available anymore I decided to design my very own keyboard from scratch.


# Rev. 1

In Rev. 1 the Knuckle Pad features a 4x6+5 keys in a ortholinear layout, offering 3 1.25u pinky keys, 4 radially positioned thumb keys and a uniquely positioned key to press with the head of your metacarpal bone (what I call "inner knuckle"). However, after actually using the first prototype the placement of said "knuckle key" turned out to be way to aggresive (too low, felt like it was in the way).

# Rev. 2

Rev. 2 features a top-mounted MCU to reduce the overall build height, but sacrifices the keys "5" and "T" for it. Furthermore, I added a slight WASD columnar stagger for better ergonomics and moved the "knuckle key" up to right under the 4th row of the 1st column. 

The 1.25u keys in the 1st col have also been replaced with 1u keys for better keycap profile compatibility. They have been moved to the edge of the PCB to still have these keys separated from the rest and emulate the feeling of a "normal" keyboard.

Rev. 2 also features VIAL support so you can map the keys to your personal preference very easily.

# Q&A:

Q: Why the knuckle key?

A: At some point in time I (unconsciously) developed the habit of using my knuckles to press CTRL when playing shooters as I pressing said key with my pinky fingers felt rather uncomfortable.

# Future plans

- <del>switch plate</del>
- <del>Bottom plate</del>
- <del>Change to black pill microcontroller</del> (No purpose in doing this anymore as pro micros with usb-c are sufficient for this kb)
- Hot-Swap
- Might design a stacked acrylic case if I'm feeling spicy (not anytime soon though)
- Since I designed this KB after finding out about the free montly prototype that allpcb offered and since I wanted to use that service I was constrained to a maximum PCB area of 15000mm^2. Consequently, I could not have BOTH a top-mounted MCU AND all rows with 6 columns. Allpcb apparently discountinued that service (atleast if you haven't bought any PCBs in the last 6 months from them), so this means that if I'm doing a Rev. 3 I will not be constrained anymore by the max size for free prototypes and can have ALL the keys + a top-mounted MCU.
